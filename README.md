# A/B Testing Summary Report

---

## 1. Objective
The goal of this A/B test was to determine if displaying different hint variations in the Opera browser increased user engagement with the new feature "m." The analysis evaluated the effectiveness of four test groups against a control group that did not receive any hint.

---

## 2. Experiment Design
- **Control Group**: Users who did not see a hint.
- **Test Groups**: Four different hint variations were tested:
  - **Big Header**
  - **Big Header Sidebar**
  - **Subheader**
  - **Subheader Sidebar**
- **Assignment Method**: Users were randomly assigned to one of the five groups to ensure unbiased results.
- **Sample Size Consideration**: Each group had an approximately equal number of users to allow for fair comparisons.
- **Metrics Evaluated**:
  - `m_clicks_total`: Total clicks on the new feature, indicating overall engagement.
  - `m_used_days`: Number of days the feature was used, measuring long-term adoption.
  - Engagement rate: Percentage of users who interacted with the feature at least once.

## 3. Key Findings

### Statistical Tests: T-Test & Z-Test
- All test groups significantly outperformed the control group in engagement.
- Big Header Sidebar performed the best (T = 4.75, Z = 14.79, p < 0.0001).
- Statistically significant improvement across all hint variations (p < 0.05).

### Confidence Intervals
- The confidence intervals did not overlap with 0, confirming that the difference in engagement was real.
- The Big Header Sidebar had the highest mean difference in engagement (Mean Diff = 13.55, 95% CI: 8.37 to 18.74).

### Effect Size (Cohenâ€™s d)
- The effect size for all test groups was small but positive (d ~ 0.20-0.24), indicating that while engagement increased, the practical significance was moderate.
- While statistically significant, the relatively small effect sizes suggest that the impact of hint variations on engagement is meaningful but not overwhelmingly strong.

### Retention Analysis (`m_used_days`)
- Users in test groups used the feature for more days than control users.
- The Big Header Sidebar again performed the best (1.30 days vs. 0.21 in the control, a +1.09 day increase).
- Even the weakest-performing variant (Subheader Sidebar) still increased retention by +0.88 days.
- This indicates that exposure to the hint contributed to continued engagement beyond an initial interaction.

### Bayesian A/B Testing
- Bayesian analysis confirmed a 100% probability that all test groups performed better than the control group.
- Further supports previous statistical findings that hints increased engagement.
- This method also provides a probabilistic view, reinforcing confidence in the observed differences.

## 4. Final Recommendations

- Deploy **Big Header Sidebar** as the primary hint format, as it led to the highest engagement and retention.
- Optimize hint wording and design to further enhance long-term retention beyond the initial click.
- Consider additional **A/B testing** to fine-tune hint placement, frequency, and messaging for maximizing user adoption.
- Explore deeper engagement metrics (e.g., feature usage patterns, session duration) to enhance user experience.
- Conduct **longitudinal analysis** to measure sustained feature engagement beyond the initial test period.

---

## 5. Conclusion
This A/B test successfully demonstrated that hint messages positively impact user engagement and retention. The **Big Header Sidebar** variant showed the strongest results, making it the best candidate for wider implementation. 

Future iterations should focus on **sustaining engagement over time**, refining hint designs for long-term feature adoption, and conducting additional tests to optimize hint effectiveness further.

### Limitations and Next Steps
- While the impact of hint messages is statistically significant, effect sizes indicate that improvements could be optimized further.
- Potential external factors (e.g., user behavior changes, seasonal effects) should be accounted for in future experiments.
- Monitoring post-deployment engagement will be crucial to ensure long-term adoption.

### Final Decision
Deploy the **Big Header Sidebar** hint variant and continue testing for further improvements while monitoring user engagement over time.
